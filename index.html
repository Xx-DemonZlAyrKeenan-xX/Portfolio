        <h3>Robotics</h3>
        <P>I like to think of myself as skilled builder and innovator in robotics. My first year I recieved 
        the innovators award for my builds. My projects include a claw, rubberband roller, and a lift. During the 2017-2018 school
            year at PPHS our robotics team made it to state. Xavier Howard and I (The Dynamic Duo) sweated profously throughout the event.
            It was a great experience. Shout out to Coach Mundell!</p>
        <h3>Running</h3>
        <p>I run cross country and track at my school. I enjoy XC more than track because of the new scenery every
        time I run. Running and hiking through forests are some of my favorite things to do. I love everything outdoors,
        anything rollercoasters, and kayaking.</p>
        <h3>15 years old</h3>
        <p>I was born on July the second, 2002. This also means I'm about to be 16! I won't be able to drive 
        until next summer though. Also, I'm growing too quickly. My sister and I are 11 months apart, meaning that 
        I'm the same age as her for around 3 weeks.(Don't tell her that.)</p>
